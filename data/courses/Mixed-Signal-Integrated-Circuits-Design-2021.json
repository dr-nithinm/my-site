  "desc": "This course covers fundamentals of data converters, Nyquist-rate converters ,central concept of oversampling and CMOS Image sensor design. This course is intended for those who seek to learn more about mixed-signal (analog plus digital) circuit design, analysis, and application. The course starts with sampling circuits, then building blocks for data converters - Opamps and Comparators, later the architecture of DACs and ADCs are covered.",
