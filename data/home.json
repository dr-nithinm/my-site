  "shortDesc": "Hi!!!, i'm Nithin, Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. \nSee the section about running tests for more information.",
  "longDesc": "If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\n\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.\n\nYou don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.",

      "dataProvider": "",
      "desc": "This course covers fundamentals of data converters, Nyquist-rate converters ,central concept of oversampling and CMOS Image sensor design. This course is intended for those who seek to learn more about mixed-signal (analog plus digital) circuit design, analysis, and application. The course starts with sampling circuits, then building blocks for data converters - Opamps and Comparators, later the architecture of DACs and ADCs are covered."

      "dataProvider": "",
      "desc": "Since the world is analog, each interface between the world and a computer will contain analog circuits. In this course, an attempt is made to make a balance between theory and practice so that the discussed circuits can be constructed in the laboratory class or simulated with a software. The laboratory classes will help to build a strong foundation on the concepts. The other important feature of this course is, it covers circuits based on both BJT and MOSFET."
